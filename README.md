# Sport_Stopwatch

Website [here](https://clem-pat.github.io/Sport_Coach/sport_coach_html/)

Small frontend interface to help you have records of your sports session. (Plots the number of repetitions in time) 
This interface was developed for the trendy challenges ["1000 push-ups in 1 hour"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CssoaCUgw0). 

In the parameters window :
 - The default values appear in black, but you can change them by pressing Return to save them. (They get changed into green)

In the main window :
 Whenever you press a '+' button, the background will change to GREEN if you're on time or RED if you're late.
 - The small number under your total number of repetitions refers to the total number of repetitions you should do to fulfil your goal. 
 - As a shortcut, you can press Space to add five repetitions. (This value is changeable by clicking on the gear in the main window)

For the plot of the final results:
 - It is automatically saved in the file where the source code is (under the name you entered previously in the parameters window)
